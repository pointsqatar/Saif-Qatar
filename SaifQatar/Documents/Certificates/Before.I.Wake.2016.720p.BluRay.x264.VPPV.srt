1
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,070
I'm sorry, Cody.

2
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,490
I've had a case come back
across my desk...

3
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,580
that could be a very good fit.

4
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,080
Cody. He's eight.

5
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,040
His birth mother died
when he was three.

6
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,130
And we placed him with
a couple that...

7
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,130
may turned out weren't fit.

8
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,590
The second couple we placed
him with abandoned him.

9
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,050
- Oh, my God.
- And I went for his annual follow up

10
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,140
I found him living alone
in the apartment.

11
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,680
- Alone?
- For almost a month, we think.

12
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,980
Neighbors called once he started
going door to door.

13
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,110
Look, I like this kid.

14
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,450
We're not supposed to have
opinions like that, but I do.

15
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,700
He's resourceful, he's resilient.

16
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,340
I'm not saying these things
haven't affected him.

17
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,370
- He's guarded, he has sleep issues.
- Of course.

18
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,120
But for all he's been through,

19
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,130
he hasn't let it turn him
into a victim.
But for all he's been through,

20
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,220
he hasn't let it turn him
into a victim.

21
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,680
Witch is what made me think
of the two of you.

22
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,230
Now that you've been approved,

23
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,730
I think you'll make wonderful
foster parents.

24
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,810
My question for you is...

25
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,110
Are you ready for this?

26
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,410
Okay, living room.

27
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,580
We can leave that one.

28
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,340
Are you sure?

29
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,640
Clean slate, you know.

30
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,470
Just that one.

31
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,970
Whatever it was like for her,

32
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,020
they said it was fast.

33
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,940
And she wasn't aware
of what was happening.

34
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:35,160
It's not nearly as bad as
I imagined in my head.

35
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,370
And I find confort in that.

36
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,460
It's very good, Jony.

37
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,670
Anyone else?

38
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,140
We have decided to bring a child
into our home tomorrow.

39
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,090
- That's wonderful, Jessie. Congratulations.
- Thank you, Peter.

40
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,930
How have you been feeling
these days?

41
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,190
I still can't sleep at night
very well.

42
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,780
- You still on Ambien?
- Yes.

43
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,150
Insomnia is common.

44
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,620
Somnia is Latin for "Dreams".

45
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,550
Insomnia simply means "No Dreams".

46
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,010
And what else is a child,
but our dreams?

47
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,850
Our hopes, manifest.

48
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,980
We talked about numbness
last week,

49
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,330
where something
a lot of us has felt.

50
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,180
Yeah, I don't know if I'm doing
any better with that.

51
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,030
I think I'm, a little.

52
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,870
but the color hasn't returned
to the world just yet.

53
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,040
How Is Mark with this?
We haven't seen him for awhile.

54
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,080
We always say that people
processes grief differently.

55
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,760
Mark and I have had
different experiences with this.

56
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,540
- The feeling distant from a spouse is...
- Common. Yes.

57
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,390
I just wish I knew
how to fix this.

58
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,090
For him, for us.

59
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,560
And I really wish he would continue
coming to group with me because...

60
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,850
it's the only time I feel...

61
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,240
I don't know...

62
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,630
Awake.

63
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,850
- You ready?
- I think so.

64
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,070
- Hey.
- Let's go say hi.

65
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,700
This is Mr and Mrs Hobsen.

66
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,490
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

67
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,040
Good morning.

68
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,380
Good morning. How are you?

69
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,210
Can I take that box for you?

70
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,880
No? Okay.
Whatever you want to do, pal.

71
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,520
Thank you. I'll take good care of it.

72
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,820
Come on, come on in.

73
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,780
Here we are.

74
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,100
You don't have to do that.

75
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,420
Shoes make floors dirty.

76
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,610
- You have a beautiful home.
- Thank you.

77
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,420
It's all yours, Cody.
Nothing's out limits.

78
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,900
Yeah, come on,
I'll show you my Xbox, or...

79
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,850
or we can get a Wii, I guess.

80
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,530
I'm not sure which one you play.
But you play, though, right?

81
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,860
I think Mark's pretty excited
to have someone to play.

82
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,090
You ever played this connect?
Sports thing?

83
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,930
It's got a censor on it,
so there is no control.

84
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,970
Whatever you do,
the little dude does.

85
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,290
You can swing, you can throw,
you can kick.

86
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,350
And the little guy does it.
I'll show you.

87
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,430
great. It's pretty mean.

88
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,240
It doesn't look like much.

89
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,320
We want you to decorate it
the way you like it

90
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,920
- really?
- That's right.

91
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,550
We're gonna replace those,
I just throw whatever in a basket,

92
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,990
but you can pick out
anything you want.

93
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,000
Cody collects butterflies.

94
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,670
- You do?
- Really?

95
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,660
I love this room.

96
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,420
remember, it's just the first night.
We are all in this together.

97
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,660
You okay?

98
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,430
I like your eyes.

99
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,980
Thank You.

100
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,930
They're really pretty.

101
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,710
Let's get some sleep.

102
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,130
Good night, Mrs Hobsen.

103
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,370
Good night, Cody.
Sleep tight.

104
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,890
Monarch.

105
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,400
Alright.

106
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,860
Here. Alright.

107
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,290
- What's your favorite kind of pizza?
- Pineapple.

108
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,630
Yeah? That's what we're
going to have tonight.

109
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,300
Celebrate your brave day.

110
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,010
Let's go, you ready?

111
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,840
So, let's all say "Welcome, Cody".

112
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:26,850
Welcome, Cody.
So, let's all say "Welcome, Cody".

113
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,100
Welcome, Cody.

114
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,760
You can take that seat,
right over there.

115
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,230
Alright, let's open those notebooks.

116
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,230
Everyone ready?

117
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,850
The first word is...

118
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,240
Everything's right in there?

119
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,250
I'm fine.
Everything's right in there?

120
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,500
I'm fine.

121
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,960
He's fine.

122
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,100
I just wanted to make sure
I can still hear him.

123
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,510
He's fine.

124
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,940
- What's this guy?
- The Blue Morpho.

125
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,350
Sounds like some kind of superhero
or something.

126
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,220
And what is this?
This is like a Cocoon or something?

127
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,390
That's a chrysalis. It keeps them
safe till they grown up.

128
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,860
So, I guess we better
go to bed.

129
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,950
Alright.

130
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,800
- I'll be right there.
- Okay, sweety.

131
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,220
Hey.

132
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,830
So, I was straightening out
for you earlier,

133
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,830
and I accidentally found
some of your stimulants.

134
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,980
Stimulants?

135
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,930
Things that keep you awake.

136
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,040
- I don't like to sleep.
- I know.

137
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,870
But there's nothing for you
to be scared of here.

138
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,120
- Yes, there is.
- What?

139
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,220
The Canker Man.

140
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,760
Who's that?

141
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,280
He comes when I sleep.
He eats people.

142
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,900
Well, that's no good.

143
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,340
He ate my mom.

144
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,260
You know, when I was little girl,

145
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,310
I thought there was a witch
scratching in my window.

146
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,720
But it was just a tree.

147
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,270
The branches had grown
a little too long,

148
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,460
And they hit the window
when the wind blew.

149
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,440
Ones I knew that, the witch
never came back.

150
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:26,010
Sometimes scary things go away
when we understand them a little.

151
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,270
Not The Canker Man.

152
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:36,270
Well, you're in new home now.
I'm sure he can't find you.

153
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,770
He's always with me, he says so.

154
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,560
You did what you had to do.

155
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,200
You can't let him have
a sugar stash,

156
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,760
in the middle of his room,
under his bed.

157
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,700
I know, I still feel like
I was trespassing.

158
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,300
No. You're parenting

159
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,910
<i>When you came in, you said
something about a ghost?</i>

160
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:09,990
<i>There was something.</i>

161
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,080
<i>What did it look like?</i>

162
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,250
<i>Well, it was wearing a black thing
that went all the way to the floor.</i>

163
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,380
<i>Weren't you a little
frightened at the time?</i>

164
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,010
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

165
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,120
<i>- That, Mr. Loren, is hysteria.
- Jess.</i>

166
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,680
<i>Well, then doctor, how do you
explain what happened to Lance?</i>

167
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:27,700
<i>Was that hysteria too?
Well, then doctor, how do you
explain what happened to Lance?</i>

168
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,530
<i>Was that hysteria too?</i>

169
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,390
<i>You better get that
checked in a day or two.</i>

170
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:35,400
<i>Thanks, doc.
You better get that
checked in a day or two.</i>

171
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,950
<i>Thanks, doc.</i>

172
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,800
Where they come from?

173
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,920
Have you ever seen this many?

174
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,560
Do we have any jars?

175
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,930
Butterflies even come out at night?

176
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,340
Maybe there is a big pretty moths.

177
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,120
- What?
- It bit me.

178
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,560
- Butterfly bit you?
- No...

179
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,250
Where are they coming from?

180
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,120
I need a lid.

181
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,660
What the hell?

182
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,260
What the hell just happened?

183
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,590
I saw something last night.

184
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,220
I think it was Sean.

185
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,130
I know we have all had
those dreams,

186
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,550
and felt like we've seen
our kids out in the world.

187
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,240
But this was different.

188
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:49,760
And I couldn't help but feel
that it was because...

189
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,210
Go ahead.

190
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,850
He knows about Cody.

191
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,270
And he's angry with me.

192
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,950
For replacing him?

193
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,250
Yeah.

194
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,950
We talked about something
ike this at the begining,

195
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,500
when Mark wanted to sell
the house,

196
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,800
- but you refused, because...
- I felt like he was still there.

197
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,350
You said you saw him sometimes.

198
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,580
Yes.

199
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,350
Okay.

200
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,250
The thing you need to understand
about the dreams

201
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,360
you can lose at dreams, it's can feel
very real while we having them.

202
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,650
This wasn't a dream.

203
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,000
- I was awake.
- Doesn't matter.

204
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,870
If we're suppressing negative
emotions like guilt or fear,

205
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,250
especially for sleep deprived
on top of that,

206
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:58,470
our subconscious will figure out
a way to process those emotions.

207
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,900
Even if we're awake.

208
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:05,770
We can even achieve levels of
REM's sleep while we're awake.

209
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,470
It's called "a waking dream".

210
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,700
It's more common than you think.

211
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,580
Just felt very real.

212
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,470
Yeah, I'm sure it did.

213
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,880
But, waking dream,
any dreams actually,

214
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,860
are convorsation that we're
having with ourselfs.

215
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,870
Every character in your dreams
is actually just you.

216
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,270
And when we're trying to
bury uncomfortable emotions,

217
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,930
or ideas, or we feel threatened,

218
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:44,320
sometimes the only outlet they
have is our subconscious.

219
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,930
It's normal for us to feel huanted,

220
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,920
by our past, by our losses,
by the children we lost.

221
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,000
But, Jessie, know.

222
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,530
Sean is not haunting your home.

223
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,830
The question is what are you
trying to say to yourself?

224
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,730
What unresolved emotions
are strangling to get out?

225
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,570
That's pretty.

226
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,980
It's a monarch.

227
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,430
Don't they have...

228
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,800
I guess so.

229
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,360
Thank god, where did you
find him this time?

230
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,460
He's in the maintenance shed,
which will be locked from now on.

231
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,220
Oh, No. Not your seat.

232
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,390
You know where you going.

233
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,770
Is this everything?

234
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:15,990
I'll do sweep.

235
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,250
Hey, pal.

236
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,430
How are you doing?
Are you alright?

237
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,060
Who is that?

238
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,300
Well, it's our son.
His name was Sean.

239
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,720
Where is he?

240
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,300
Well...

241
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,750
He's in heaven.

242
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,920
That's where my mom is.

243
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,670
Tell me, what was she like?

244
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,460
I don't remember her.

245
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,980
How did Sean go to heaven?

246
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,570
We wish he hadn't.

247
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:32,090
As like I'm sure you wish
your mom hadn't.

248
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,830
He looks fun.

249
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,550
<i>Are you in fear losing your car?</i>

250
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,600
<i>Sounds familiar?</i>

251
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:07,610
<i>If you owe more than ten thousand
dollars to the bank or the IRS,

252
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:10,890

Hey, Jess.

262
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,580
Look who's back.

263
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,700
where the hell they coming from?

264
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,780
No.

265
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,660
No.

266
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,980
I'm sorry.

267
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,270
He's real.

268
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,340
You saw him.

269
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,060
Touched him.

270
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,120
I did, I was right there.

271
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,650
I'm sorry.

272
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,320
Why?

273
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,810
My dream.

274
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,420
What do you mean, Cody?

275
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,150
What happens when you dream?

276
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:23,900
I won't do it again.
Please, don't be mad.

277
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:28,960
- Oh, hey. Pal, we're not...
- Honey, we're not mad.

278
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,740
I hope you have a good day, Jessie.

279
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,140
You too.

280
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,620
I wish we could've heard his voice.

281
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,650
Alright, who wants to set the table?

282
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,420
- Come on, buddy.
- Pizza!

283
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,230
- I think you have to dive into the water.
- Okay, you're... okay.

284
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,300
Okay, That's one more
round for you, buddy.

285
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,350
Hey, Cody.

286
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,180
You know, yesterday you were
asking about Sean?

287
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,720
You want to see him?

288
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,220
Yes, please.

289
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,770
When's the last time you
had a real Christmas?

290
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,720
I don't know.

291
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,310
You will this year.

292
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:38,230
<i>- Here he comes, here he comes.
- He's coming, he's coming.</i>

293
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,880
<i>- He came! He came!
- That's him.</i>

294
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,790
<i>Merry Christmas, baby!</i>

295
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,010
<i>What do you think?</i>

296
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,510
<i>- I think it's a train.
- Why? Did it whistle?</i>

297
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,100
<i>Oh, did Sean write train?
I don't remember...</i>

298
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,820
<i>you sent to Santa
you think about the train.</i>

299
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,850
<i>What is it?</i>

300
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:04,960
<i>I can't see it.</i>

301
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,340
<i>What do you think, hun?</i>

302
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,810
<i>North Pole Express.
Do you know who lives in there?</i>

303
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,720
<i>North Pole Express.</i>

304
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,410
<i>- Santa lives there.
- Yes, he lives there.</i>

305
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,490
<i>North Pole Express.</i>

306
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,170
<i>Oh my god, come on,
fight back, buddy.</i>

307
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,590
<i>You can escape.</i>

308
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,420
He used to give me Eskimo kisses.

309
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,680
You see how he does that?

310
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,860
<i>Where you going, buddy?</i>

311
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,090
That's right, you didn't sleep well
last night, right?

312
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,830
In this house it's okay for you
to relax.

313
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,500
You're home.

314
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,780
Now get some sleep.

315
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,540
I'm putting on another pot.

316
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,920
Oh, let's call it the night.

317
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,320
- he's a tough, and he needs to sleep.
- I know, baby. so do we.

318
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,220
Let's go to bed.

319
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,680
I'm going to make another pot.

320
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,890
Okay. I'll go to bed.

321
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:57,980
Jess.

322
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,530
Jess.

323
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,300
He came! He came!

324
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,780
I think it's a train!

325
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,020
Why? Did it whistle?

326
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,370
Cody.

327
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:30,230
<i>I am always with you.</i>

328
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,810
Let's go to bed.

329
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,650
What is that?

330
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,400
The Canker Man.

331
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:40,260
Sometimes, if I do this,
it keeps him away.

332
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:56,420
- Boys are home.
- Hi there.

333
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,010
Okay, go on.

334
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,510
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah, I'm a little hunger.

335
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,020
Yeah? Okay.

336
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,720
Why don't you go upstairs,
and wash your hands,

337
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,470
and come back and tell me
all about your day?

338
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,760
Okay? Okay.

339
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,210
Are we going to talk about this?

340
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,460
He needs to sleep.

341
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,930
Okay, he needs to sleep.

342
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,120
Yeah, Cody needs to sleep.

343
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:13,410
But, Jessie,
is that what it is about?

344
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,200
Or is this about Sean?

345
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,210
Okay.

346
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,240
What are you doing?

347
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,350
This feels wrong, Jess.

348
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,400
This...

349
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,800
I felt wrong...

350
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,770
when you... you puting that DVD.

351
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,310
And then...

352
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,770
It hasn'n felt right since.

353
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,890
It feels like abuse.

354
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,010
- Abuse?
- Yeah.

355
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:52,690
Abuse?

356
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:56,750
We promised to take care
of that child.

357
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:02,510
Not use him like some
home movie projector for...

358
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,680
That child needs to sleep.

359
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,060
And if he can help us heal...

360
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,150
We need to heal, Mark.

361
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:19,360
- He can help us heal.
- This is not healing.

362
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:19,370
I saw it in your face.
You felt it too.
- He can help us heal.
- This is not healing.

363
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,460
I saw it in your face.
You felt it too.

364
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:25,780
Yeah, of course.

365
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,870
If you want to go to bed,
go to bed.

366
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,240
Jess.

367
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:34,250
I'm staying here,
and I'm waiting for Sean.
Jess.

368
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,340
I'm staying here,
and I'm waiting for Sean.

369
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,010
Well, it's not our son,
and it's not Sean,

370
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,840
and it's not our son.

371
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,640
I'm not going to let you
take him away from me again.

372
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,010
Again?

373
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,310
hey.

374
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,700
I'm sorry.

375
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,870
- Again?
- I'm sorry.

376
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:09,830
No. Not fair.

377
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,760
It's not fair. Not fair.

378
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,680
You all set?

379
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,320
Okay, go ahead

380
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,840
You started it, Tate.

381
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,900
Thirteen plus five?

382
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:11,150
- Hayden?
- Eighteen?

383
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:11,160
Yes.
- Hayden?
- Eighteen?

384
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,190
Yes.

385
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,490
Fifteen plus four?

386
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,370
- Hunter?
- Nineteen.

387
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,300
Good.

388
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,890
Seven plus thirteen?

389
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,220
- Clara?
- Twenty?

390
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:29,760
Nice.

391
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,600
Nine plus fourteen.

392
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:35,100
This time is fine.

393
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,060
but if you're not
feeling well for recess,

394
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:39,100
maybe you should visit
the nurses room.

395
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,610
Can I just stay here?

396
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:53,700
I have to step out,
just for a minute,

397
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,500
Why not you put your
head down and rest?

398
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,750
Cody, what's going on?

399
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:51,910
Let's go home.

400
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,950
What happened?

401
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:54,740
A kid run away.

402
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:55,960
What?

403
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:58,670
He's done it before.
He's a mean kid.

404
00:46:58,670 --> 00:46:58,680
Can we go home, please?
He's done it before.
He's a mean kid.

405
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,520
Can we go home, please?

406
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,190
Okay.

407
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,320
You okay?

408
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,980
I'm fine.

409
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,830
Well, we didn't see very much
even the night.

410
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,610
I'm sorry, I don't feel a very well.

411
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:23,290
Don't feel well?

412
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:26,000
Let's have a look at you.

413
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,050
Worried about what happened
at school today?

414
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:37,260
Well, I think it's going to be okay,
that little boy is going to turn up.

415
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:49,730
- Good night.
- Good night.

416
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,690
Well, You...

417
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,400
You're going to use
some sleep too, you know?

418
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:57,410
I'll be in soon.

419
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,330
Okay.

420
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,620
I'm awake, this can't be hapening.

421
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:33,170
I'm awake, this can't be hapening.

422
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,300
No! No, no!

423
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,020
- I'm awake. I'm awake.
- I'm awake. I'm awake.

424
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:48,030
- I'm awake.
- I'm awake.
- I'm awake. I'm awake.
- I'm awake. I'm awake.

425
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:51,320
- I'm awake.
- I'm awake.

426
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,450
I'm awake.

427
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,020
No! No!

428
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:56,030
- No! I'm awake!
- Cody? Cody?!
No! No!

429
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:58,110
- No! I'm awake!
- Cody? Cody?!

430
00:50:58,110 --> 00:50:58,120
- No! Stop!
- Cody, stop.
- No! I'm awake!
- Cody? Cody?!

431
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,950
- No! Stop!
- Cody, stop.

432
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:04,090
- I'm awake! I'm awake!
- I got you. I got you.

433
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:08,620
I'm awake. I'm awake.
- I got you. Hey, I got you.

434
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:08,630
- I'm awake. I'm awake.
- Oh, it's okay, baby. It's okay.
I'm awake. I'm awake.
- I got you. Hey, I got you.

435
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:13,090
- I'm awake. I'm awake.
- Oh, it's okay, baby. It's okay.

436
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:18,180
I'm sick.
I don't want to go to school.

437
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:19,640
Sick, huh?

438
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:20,980
Yes, sir.

439
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:20,990
That's too bad.
Yes, sir.

440
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:22,120
That's too bad.

441
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:26,480
I guess you won't be interested in
do a little shopping today.

442
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,610
Pick up some stuff
for your new room.

443
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:31,780
I don't think I deserve to.

444
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:39,290
If there is one thing I know,
you deserve a good day.

445
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,620
- How long hasn't he slept?
- At least two days.

446
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:45,630
But it's been going on
since he first got home.

447
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:48,290
I'm giving him Zolpidem.
It's a paediatric Ambien.

448
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:50,120
Just a pill before bedtime
should do the trick.

449
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:50,130
<i>Dr. Petrom room six, one.
Dr. Petrom room six, one.
Just a pill before bedtime
should do the trick.</i>

450
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:53,630
<i>Dr. Petrom room six, one.
Dr. Petrom room six, one.</i>

451
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,250
It's just to get him started.

452
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:55,260
We can't let him stay up
for days on end.
It's just to get him started.

453
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,350
We can't let him stay up
for days on end.

454
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:00,060
Sleep deprivation at this age
can do real damage.

455
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:02,840
Thank you.

456
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,960
- Hi.
- Hi.

457
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,840
Can I help you guys?

458
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:31,470
I'm detective Brown,
this is officer Murray.

459
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,930
We like to ask your son
a few questions

460
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:36,080
about an incident that
took place at school.

461
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:39,140
Cody, come here.

462
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:49,070
- Okay, screw.
- Screw.

463
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:53,580
- Phillips.
- Phillips.

464
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:04,710
Just be sure you cough or something
when you get downstairs, okay?

465
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,020
Hey, there he is.

466
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,930
- You look better.
- I feel a little better.

467
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:20,690
- Good.
- So, the police came by today.

468
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:23,360
- What they want?
- Well...

469
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:23,370
I feel a lot better.
- What they want?
- Well...

470
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:24,790
I feel a lot better.

471
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,490
Do you want to see
my race car bed?

472
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:26,500
- Race car bed?
- I was getting to that.
Do you want to see
my race car bed?

473
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,870
- Race car bed?
- I was getting to that.

474
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:32,210
I think this little kid
still hasn't shown back up.

475
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:33,980
So, why they came here?

476
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:36,930
Well, I guess they have to
rule out abduction.

477
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:39,050
I guess Cody saw the kid leave.

478
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,510
How did Sean die?

479
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:44,720
What?

480
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,390
I just wondered.

481
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,780
Hey, buddy.

482
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,450
Why not you go set the table?
Okay?

483
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,660
We'll be in in minute.

484
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:40,960
Nice.

485
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,000
Like Tik Tak Tok game.
I'm playing it always.

486
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,630
- Hi.
- Hi.

487
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,220
- What do you think?
- That is orange.

488
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,300
Weren't you glad
we didn't go with fuchsia?

489
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,640
- What's this?
- Here you go.

490
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:04,310
Alright.

491
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:08,110
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

492
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:11,900
Using fork?

493
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,370
This is very civilized.

494
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:37,100
- Today was fun.
- Today was my favorite day so far.

495
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:40,350
Yeah? Mine, too.

496
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,480
Hey, listen...

497
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,610
About the question that
you asked me...

498
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:50,660
...earlier.

499
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:56,960
Sean drowned.
It was an accident.

500
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:02,880
And then, we found out
we couldn't have more kids, so...

501
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:06,430
I'm sorry I asked about that.

502
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:10,590
No, no. It's...

503
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,060
You have the right to know.

504
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:16,220
It's just important to you also
to know that...

505
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:16,230
nothing like that is
going to happen to you.
It's just important to you also
to know that...

506
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:19,110
nothing like that is
going to happen to you.

507
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,760
You okay?

508
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:49,850
I don't think I am.

509
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:53,770
You're a great mom.

510
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:00,110
That kid up there...

511
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:04,780
He needs a great mom.

512
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,540
You need a kid.
It's a perfect match.

513
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:12,550
We don't need anything else.

514
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:26,930
I know that you think you do.

515
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:31,690
And god knows there's a big
part of me it feels the same.

516
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:37,150
But we don't.

517
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,750
Come to bed.

518
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,970
Come to bed.

519
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,600
Okay.

520
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,980
Yes, love.

521
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:49,380
Sean?

522
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:05,460
Cody, Cody.
Wake up, wake up.

523
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:17,010
- Wake up, hunny. Wake up!
- Mark.

524
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,600
Won't wake up.

525
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:21,270
He won't, for a while.

526
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,150
- What did you do?
- He's...

527
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:27,230
Cody!

528
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:31,700
Cody, Cody! Wake up!

529
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:34,110
Come on, wake up.

530
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,240
Get out of here!

531
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:29,100
She won't wake up.
She won't wake up.

532
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:30,810
Here.

533
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:34,230
She's awake. She's awake.

534
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,730
I like to take your formal
statement, Mrs Hobsen

535
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:44,690
and then, refer you to someone
in social services.

536
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:48,450
- Social services?
- Why did you drug the child?

537
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,410
I...

538
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:55,720
gave him a sleeping pill.
His doctor prescribed it.

539
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,390
You know the whereabouts
of your husband

540
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:00,370
day before last
around lunch time?

541
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:01,220
Where you taking him?

542
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:03,510
We have any reason
to be near of your son's school?

543
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:03,520
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Ma'am, Ma'am.
We have any reason
to be near of your son's school?

544
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,450
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Ma'am, Ma'am.

545
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:07,550
I'm sorry.

546
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:07,560
Ma'am, we have to remove
the child from the house.
I'm sorry.

547
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,070
Ma'am, we have to remove
the child from the house.

548
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:11,730
- No, please.
- Ma'am, please.

549
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:11,740
You can't take him away.
- No, please.
- Ma'am, please.

550
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:13,730
You can't take him away.

551
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:00,490
Natalie.

552
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,080
You haven't returned
my phone calls.

553
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,040
I was at the police station, all night.

554
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:09,760
Where is he?

555
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,560
It's not your business any more.

556
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:17,270
Where's your husband?

557
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:19,650
I don't know.

558
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,020
That's why I have to talk with Cody.

559
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:23,480
That's not going to happen.

560
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:25,980
I need to find out more
about him.

561
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:28,550
About his dreams.

562
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:35,370
You've heard this before.

563
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:42,580
There're several great spport
groups in here,

564
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:45,630
and a few therapists who
specialize in domestic violence.

565
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:48,590
I want you to reach out,
get some help for your situation.

566
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,930
And I never want to see you again.

567
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:35,180
Yeah, I'm so able
to take care of it.

568
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:35,190
- Great. Thanks.
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm so able
to take care of it.

569
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:36,730
- Great. Thanks.
- Yeah.

570
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,730
- Hi, can I help you?
- I'm here to see Whelan Young.

571
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:48,450
Whelan, you have a visitor.

572
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,330
Thank you.

573
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,290
What can I do for you?

574
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,830
I'm here to talk about Cody Morgan.

575
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,980
It says here that you
and your wife Katharina

576
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:17,860
fostered Cody for 15 months

577
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:22,030
before he was gaven to
Peter and Doris Clemens.

578
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:24,910
Wouldn't know about them.

579
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,820
They disappeared a year ago.

580
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:30,330
Much like your wife.

581
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,120
What are we talking
about here, Miss?

582
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:37,580
We're talking about
what happens when he dreams.

583
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,310
I've seen it, too.

584
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:44,180
You have now?

585
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,610
I watched it take my husband.

586
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,690
I wouldn't say that around here.

587
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:56,450
They fit you for slippers.

588
01:04:57,830 --> 01:04:59,400
If you don't know
what I'm talking about,

589
01:04:59,400 --> 01:04:59,410
- then I'm wasting importent time.
- Hey, wait.
If you don't know
what I'm talking about,

590
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:01,950
- then I'm wasting importent time.
- Hey, wait.

591
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,650
I'm sorry.

592
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:04,660
You know, I hear "you're crazy"
for so long
I'm sorry.

593
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,610
You know, I hear "you're crazy"
for so long

594
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:06,620
before you start to believe it.
You know, I hear "you're crazy"
for so long

595
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,540
before you start to believe it.

596
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:11,420
Please.

597
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,550
That little boy's dreams
come true.

598
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:26,310
Real and true.

599
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,480
It's an amazing, beautiful thing.

600
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:35,070
But so to his nightmares...

601
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,150
They're...

602
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:39,300
Dangerous.

603
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:43,620
Deadly.

604
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:46,470
Can I get him back?

605
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,500
My husband?

606
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:55,340
I don't know.

607
01:05:55,710 --> 01:06:01,190
Wherever that thing comes from,
it takes them with it.

608
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,340
If they exist at all,
it's only in Cody's mind

609
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:06,690
How do you know that?

610
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:11,090
Katie and I fostered
two kids before Cody.

611
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:14,600
His mother died, no other family.

612
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:19,770
He was sweet, independent.

613
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:19,780
An artist, I thought.
He was sweet, independent.

614
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:21,670
An artist, I thought.

615
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:25,840
Started with the butterflies.

616
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:55,330
That went on for a few weeks.

617
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:58,960
We though it was magical.

618
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:02,120
And then, Katie got sick.

619
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,750
had a bad flu.

620
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:11,130
And it seemed to really upset Cody.

621
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,190
And then...

622
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:43,550
No!

623
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,480
I'm sorry.

624
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,330
But wasn't Katie.

625
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:44,460
It was jus his impression of her.

626
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:48,920
That was all what was left.

627
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:54,260
He was too young.

628
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:58,180
He was too young...

629
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:02,700
to even remember her right.

630
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:08,610
And I hated him for that.

631
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:13,990
I know I shouldn't have,
but god help me I hated him for that.

632
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,330
But I couldn't do it.

633
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:24,410
I couldn't do it.

634
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,750
If I had, you're husband
would be alive.

635
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:33,920
That another family would be alive.

636
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,720
Maybe you can...

637
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,100
succeed where I failed.

638
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:44,100
No.

639
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:46,690
No.

640
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:47,870
It's the only way.

641
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:50,320
Thank you for your time.

642
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:53,870
And I'm sorry for your loss,
as well.

643
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,850
You really want to bet your life
to an eighteen year old boy

644
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:58,120
won't have another nightmare?

645
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,960
- It's not his fault.
- It'd be a mercy.

646
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:06,720
Someone has to do it.

647
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:10,010
Do you know anything
about his birth mother?

648
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,760
There's nothing in the file.

649
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:15,640
Only that she died.

650
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:21,400
I assume the way my wife did.

651
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,610
The way your husband did.

652
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,110
What you hoping to find?

653
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:34,110
Dr. Tennant told me not to come back
without the patient file.

654
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:35,360
He's try to call.

655
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:37,690
Do you have the PID?

656
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:40,820
I don't, all I have is
a last name and a date.

657
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:49,330
Night nurse said he didn't
sleep last night.

658
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:51,210
That's two nights in a row, then.

659
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:53,370
That we know of.

660
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:56,540
Policy says that we can't
let him go this long.

661
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,470
I'd like to stay here with him
tonight if that's okay.

662
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,760
You signed for the file,
you can take it.

663
01:12:18,190 --> 01:12:20,490
There is a PE numbere here
on the intake.

664
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:22,250
How long you keep those?

665
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:25,880
If nobody claim them, there's a chance
they're still down there.

666
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,720
No! No!

667
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:16,760
- Cody, its for your own good.
- Honey, it's alright.

668
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:18,840
I don't want to hurt anymore.

669
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,470
It'll take a second.

670
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,090
Good job, son.

671
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,040
It's okay.

672
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:32,070
A case of mine was transferred,

673
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:34,290
and I need the name of
the facility for the report.

674
01:13:34,730 --> 01:13:38,330
Natalie Friedman.
F-R-I-E-D-M-A-N.

675
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:41,630
Provider number, 11714.

676
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:45,670
Cody Morgan.

677
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:33,380
Where is he?

678
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:55,110
Mommy.

679
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:24,440
Cody?

680
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,980
It keeps them safe.

681
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:11,150
Until they grown up.

682
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:22,240
let them go.

683
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,050
Wait!

684
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:18,770
I'm taking him home.

685
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:54,380
This is for you.

686
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:57,730
It's your mother's journal.

687
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:04,820
Your mother's name was
Andrea Morgan.

688
01:25:05,990 --> 01:25:08,030
And I can tell by reading this,

689
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,410
She loved you very, very much.

690
01:25:14,990 --> 01:25:18,130
When you were a baby,
she noticed you're a special.

691
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:30,010
It was just the two of you
against the world.

692
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:37,400
She writes a lot about you,
and about your gift.

693
01:25:37,970 --> 01:25:41,270
And how much she loved
watching you grow.

694
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:51,080
I don't think she's stopped
writing because she didn't want to.

695
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:53,870
I think it's because...

696
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:56,830
She got sick.

697
01:25:59,910 --> 01:26:03,000
Which just happen sometimes.

698
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:12,110
These are some of your
mother's test results.

699
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:15,900
Do you see that word there?

700
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:18,780
Canker.

701
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,450
Not quite.

702
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:33,500
It's difficult to explain
what cancer is to children.

703
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,340
In terms they can understand.

704
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:44,350
Your mother started to look
very different, very fast.

705
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:51,800
And by the time she was
in the Intensive Care Unit,

706
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:55,030
they started looking
a foster parents for you.

707
01:26:56,100 --> 01:27:00,620
But they would've brought you in
to see her one last time.

708
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,200
To say goodbye.

709
01:27:17,210 --> 01:27:19,550
Her voice would've been
hard to hear.

710
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:24,100
But I know she would've
tried to say, if she could.

711
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:27,270
The one thing she would never
want you to forget.

712
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:29,360
I...

713
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:35,620
...am always with you.

714
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:42,290
Once you got older,
you'd forget most of this.

715
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:46,630
And you told people the
Canker ate your mommy.

716
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,260
And as more time
went by...

717
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,260
in your mind.

718
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:58,180
The Canker Man ate my mom.

719
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,730
Into your mind, Cody.

720
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:10,030
Your amazing, special
one of kind mind,

721
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:11,860
made him real.

722
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:15,660
I'm so sorry.

723
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:18,200
I'm so sorry.

724
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:23,170
I used you, like I did for Sean.

725
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:32,340
But I'll never do
that again, okay?

726
01:28:33,430 --> 01:28:34,540
Never.

727
01:28:39,330 --> 01:28:43,140
Here we go.
Here. Close to me, there.

728
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:48,490
Remember, nothing
to worry about, okay?

729
01:28:49,650 --> 01:28:52,210
I'm going to be here
with you, all night.

730
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,420
Will you tell me a bedtime story?

731
01:28:59,030 --> 01:29:00,210
Sure.

732
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:08,010
Once upon a time...

733
01:29:09,450 --> 01:29:12,060
There was a special little boy...

734
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:14,810
Who needed a mom.

735
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:22,320
And there was a sad mom
she needed a son.

736
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:25,530
Is this a happy story?

737
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:28,200
I think it is.

738
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:31,950
Has a happy ending, anyway.

739
01:29:32,530 --> 01:29:35,080
It feels like it can't.

740
01:29:35,990 --> 01:29:40,920
Because there was a people
going away.

741
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:45,430
No one ever really goes away.

742
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:47,760
Not completely.

743
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:53,520
Because they live in our minds,
and in our hearts.

744
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,240
In this story...

745
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:04,080
That bully from school
woke up in his bed,

746
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:06,160
like nothing ever happened.

747
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:11,460
And whatever made him
so sad and mean, has gone.

748
01:30:14,290 --> 01:30:16,800
And that nice lady
who care for the boy,

749
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:19,390
she came back to her hasbund,

750
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,350
and they lived happily
ever after.

751
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:32,820
And daddy...

752
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:40,990
Daddy got the best present of all.

753
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:55,630
Can those things happen?

754
01:30:59,630 --> 01:31:01,760
I guess that depends on you, Cody.

755
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:06,220
You have an amazing gift.

756
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,810
Who knows what can happen
as it grows?

757
01:31:13,310 --> 01:31:15,450
Thanks for bringing me home.

758
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:19,920
Mom.
